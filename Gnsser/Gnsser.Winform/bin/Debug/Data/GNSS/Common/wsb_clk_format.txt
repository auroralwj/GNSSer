Our clk files (gr2 and grg files since GPS week 1686) contain specail additional comment lines
giving the wsb values used to build our clocks solution. 

The WL COMMENT line format contains (in fortran notation):
format("WL ",a1,i0.2,1x,1x,i4,4(i3),f10.6,i3,3x,e13.6,2x,i0.2,i0.2,1x,'COMMENT')
a1         : 'G' for GPS
i0.2       : prn
i4 , 4(i3) : yyyy mm day hh min  (mm = month)
f10.6      : sec
Note       : hh  min sec equals always '12  0  0.000000'  (middle of the current day)
i3         : always one (some unused validity code)
e13.6      : value of the wide lane bias (WSB in unit of WL cycles) 
             used for this particular clock solution.
i0.2, i0.2 : frequency channel (1 and 2 for GPS L1, L2; 
             this can be used to define other combinations, e.g. 1,5 for Galileo)

Normally these values should be the one used for the processing and should be identical to the values
    given in the wsb fileftp://ftpsedr.cls.fr/pub/igsac/Wide_lane_GPS_satellite_biais.wsb.  
But, this is not exactly the case for grg products, since the current procedure (inspired by the initial
    weekly processing) is as follow:
  1. to process a particular day we use the predicted WSB values (the one of the previous day)
  2. we compute corrections for the current day
  3. then we update the file with the computed corrections
  4. We finally insert the corrected values in our clk file for the igs submission.
This procedure is not ideal since the exactly used values are not insured to be the one indicated in the clk file.
  
The one exactly used are the values of the previous day. We should correct that in the future.
In practice, variations from one day to the other are so tiny that the fixed WL ambiguities are the 
same using the predicted or the corrected values. But this may be no more the case when rapid variations 
of this bias occur.

Grg 30s clocks are available since  week 1686 (and clk file contains the WSB used since this date). 
Changes have been made, in particular in the clock alignment procedure, since this particular week making 
grg products  not fully  homogeneous over the all period.
gr2 products:
-------------
For a better consistency in the past it is recommended to use gr2 products
(integer clocks products from 04/2000 to 31/12/2013) available at cddis under the names: 
      ftp://cddis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/gps/products/WWWW/repro2/gr2....
These gr2 products do not suffer from the discrepancy between used and indicated WSB values described above.
The WSB values indicated in the gr2...clk files are in that case exactly the same as the one used.
